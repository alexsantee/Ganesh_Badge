The board is entirely based on [Ganesh](https://ganesh.icmc.usp.br/)'s logo, the back side has the logo printed in silkscreen and the front side has a circuit part shaped like the logo, which serves as a ground plane. The front also has the names of our main study areas.

The project is based in the PIC10F200 microcontroler, which offers low cost, decent current sourcing and 4 I/O pins.
The PCB features an LED, header pins intended as a serial and a programming interfaces and a button. These are for creating simple CTF-like challenges yielding a flag, being the button a mean of switching which challenges are currently running.
The lower part of the board has an USB micro-B connector for powering and the top part has a hole intended for easy carrying as a keychain, necklace or even nailing it to a wall.

The PCB was made in KiCAD and intended for low-cost manufacturing at JLCPCB
