# custom_footprints

The MicroQTJ and TS-1187A-B-A-B, are footprints for the USB Micro-B port and the button, which were not available by default at KiCAD.
MicroQTJ_2pads and SOT-23-6_narrow, are modified versions of the USB and MCU footprints to let the pads farther apart and reduce the chance of manufacturing errors.
